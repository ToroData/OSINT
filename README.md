## Whois<a name="id1"></a>
Whois is a tool that uses the TCP protocol that allows queries to be made to a database that contains information about the domain of web pages. Probably, as you know, a web use a TCP/IP protocol and every web has an IP though you see a something like www.domain.com. Every web has at least DNS to convert the IP to a direction to be able to remember it easily. So that it is important to see if we can collect some data about it. Later we will see how you can collect specific information about it.

```
$ whois www.nike.es
```
The result you get when you run the last command is (the output is formatted for better readability):

As you can see the output shows directions, emails, servers, etc. that it is very relevant for gathering information to exploit later. I encourage to you to think what you can do with this data and what parts of it are the most relevant for you.
